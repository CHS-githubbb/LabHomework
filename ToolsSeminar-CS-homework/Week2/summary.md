# A Summary of The Inproceedings --- [*Astra: Exploiting Predictability to Optimize Deep Learning*](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/search?q=Astra%3A+Exploiting+Predictability+to+Optimize+Deep+Learning+)


## **Problems To Be Solved** </br>
* The major hand-coded accelerators to speed up DNN training only cater to most popular primitive and are not efficient for long tailed models

## **Motivation of The Research**
*  Novel model architectures that AI researchers invent are long tailed, and are not well accelerated by hand-coded accelerators
*  The efficiency of these long-tail models is crucial to AI innovation

## **Contribution To The Research**

* The researchers present Astra, a system that automatically optimizes the long-tail models to achieve performance
similar to hand-coded accelerators
